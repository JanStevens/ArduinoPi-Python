# ArduinoPi Python Controller
The ArduinoPi Python controller is the Python version of the succesfull PHP based application used to controller your RaspberryPi with your Arduino.
The Python controller uses Flask (so make sure you install this first) and PySerial.        
The controller is in its very early stage and currently only supports basic tasks.
